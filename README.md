# i386 Emulator

This project aims to provide an i386 emulator primarily for educational purposes, but it can also be used for real emulation needs as well. The first goal of this project is to create a functional command-line interface (CLI) emulator with its assembler. Therefore, it can be considered a project within a project.

## Features
- Emulates the i386 architecture
- Can be used for educational or real emulation needs
- Provides a CLI interface for easy use
- Includes an assembler for creating machine code
- Open-source and freely available for use and modification
